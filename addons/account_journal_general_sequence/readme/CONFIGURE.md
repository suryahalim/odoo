To configure journal sequences:

1.  Have full accounting permissions.
2.  Go to *Invoicing \> Configuration \> Accounting \> Journals*.
3.  Select or create the journal you want to configure.
4.  Use *Account entry number sequence* to configure a sequence.

Note that:

- Various journals can share the same sequence.
- All journals get a shared default sequence, per company.
- Entry numbers must be unique per company. So, if you use different
  sequences per journal, make sure they don't produce colliding results.
