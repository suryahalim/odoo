Asset Management App Documentation
====================================

1. Types
========
The Types facility is crucial for categorizing assets and determining their depreciation methods. It serves as the foundation for how assets are managed and valued over time.

Detailed Explanation:
---------------------

1.1. Name
    A unique identifier for each asset type. Examples include "Office Equipment", "Vehicles", "Machinery", or "IT Hardware".

1.2. Depreciation Frequency
    Determines how often depreciation is calculated. Options typically include:

    - Monthly: Depreciation is calculated at the end of each month.
    - Yearly: Depreciation is calculated once a year.
    - Days: Depreciation is calculated on a daily basis, allowing for more precise pro-rata calculations.

1.3. Depreciation Value Type
    Specifies the method used to calculate depreciation. Common methods include:

    - Fix: A fixed amount is depreciated in each period, regardless of the asset's remaining value.
    - Percentage: A percentage of the asset's current value is depreciated each period.

1.4. Depreciation Rate
    The percentage at which the asset depreciates each period. For example, a 10% annual depreciation rate means the asset loses 10% of its value each year.

1.5. Depreciation Start Delay
    The time period before depreciation begins. This is useful for assets that aren't immediately put into service after purchase. For example, a 3-month delay for equipment that requires installation.

1.6. Depreciation Basis
    The initial value used to calculate depreciation. Options may include:

    - Purchase price: The original cost of the asset.
    - Book value: The value of the asset as recorded on the balance sheet.

1.7. Maximum Depreciation Entries
    The total number of depreciation entries allowed for the asset. This is often tied to the asset's expected useful life. For example, a computer with a 5-year life might have 60 monthly entries or 20 quarterly entries.
